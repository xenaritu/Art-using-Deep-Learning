# Art-using-Deep-Learning
This repository is dedicated to generating art and poetry using deep learning models

Here's a poem generated using seq2seq model using poems by Rober Frost:

by me as i was.
i though to the garden ground,
and put a sign up closed to take those signals are
though what i never heard of a house

in winter after half-past three.
but not the poetess's poems.
i staid the sees me on foot
to everything, he gave it now

to see if some magic of door
boys and then such a window
in every way of the sun
the spell that would have been too strong in me

except, it seemed, the poetess's poems.
so and was no say didn't know. it in the eyes?'
'yes, stark. and you?'
first could have the fallen off,

nothing came for this was up of it
anyone else, but out of idleness.
the sigmas and taus
and spoke of the sun
